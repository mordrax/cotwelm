{-|
The inventory module predominantlys acts as the user interface for the 'i'nventory and shop screen.
It handles equipping, buy/sell, identification, moving items into packs and other general inventory related logic.

The module subscribes to mouse events for item interactions and is generally high level because it needs
to know about hero equipment, items, containers etc...
