{-|
Monsters are the main ways to advance in the game. They exist in the dungeon levels only and get progressively more dangerous
as you venture deeper.

Monsters are separated into types, each type will have special characteristics such as the dragons all having
a form of elemental attack or the undeads being able to drain stats.

Monsters do not have levels, instead what determines their difficulty is their stats and attributes. Each monster type has
a base set of attributes which is changed by specific monsters of that type. Their stats (hp/sp) is determined by their
size and type.
